/**
 * Module entry point.
 *
 * Sections built as ES modules register themselves here; navTo() in
 * index.html dispatches to them. This is the only file that touches
 * `window` at module scope, which keeps every section module importable
 * under Node for testing.
 *
 * The contract is `{ init }` — nothing more. navTo() calls init() once, on
 * first visit; everything else a section needs (its Refresh button, its
 * modal) it wires up itself from inside init().
 *
 * Adding an extracted section later is two lines: import it, register it.
